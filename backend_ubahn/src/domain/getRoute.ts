 * You can assume `allLines` to be the sample data included in this project, which means you can make the following assumptions:
 *  - all stations are interconnected, so it should always be possible to find a valid Route.
 *  - there's a finite set of stations with a size of around ~100

 *   "line": (U9)

 *   "action": "switch",
